Data Mining Project for Hood College CSIT 599G Course Summer 2014

CSIT 599G Computational Data Mining
Summer II 2014

Course Syllabus


Course Description: With explosive growth of data collected by sensors and in business transactions, Data Mining has become instrumental to extract interesting information and meaningful understanding out of them.  Statistics and machine learning techniques are used in classification, clustering, the discovery of association rules and sequence patterns, and anomaly detection.  This course gives a rapid and vigorous introduction to data mining as well as provides hands-on experience via small data mining projects.  Throughout the semester, students work towards building a course project which will incorporate knowledge and skills learned along the way.  This is a three-credit course.

This project-oriented course proceeds in seminar style, and concludes with a presentation of term projects.  CS student and non-CS students have different paths and expectations, to be discussed in the orientation meeting. 

This course, together with CS 566 Parallel Computing and CS 565 Database System Concepts, provide students essential skill sets to undertake tasks in Big Data.

Time: 18:00-21:10 Tuesday,Thursday
Location: HT 236/HT 319

Prerequisites: 
A- or above from CS 519 Advanced Data Structures (for CS students), or 
A- or above from IT 530 Applied Database Systems (non-CS students)

We will utilize a number of open source data analysis packages and web-based tools in this course; programming per se is not required for non-CS students.  Basic concepts in statistics, linear algebra and machine learning are discussed along course contents.  For example, we do not perform eigenvalue decomposition, support vector machine or Fourier transform by hand.  Instead, we discuss where, when and how to apply these methods to extract interesting results from a data set.

Student Learning Outcomes:
●	Understand various classification, clustering, association rule-mining algorithms and anomaly detection;
●	Understand capabilities provided by various data analysis methods and tools;
●	Apply Data Mining techniques to large scale real world data;

Instructor: Dr. Xinlian Liu
Office Hours: by appointment only.

Textbook: Pang-Ning Tan, Michael Steinbach and Vipin Kumar, 2006.  Introduction to Data Mining, Addison Wesley

Class Website: We use the College 'Blackboard' system.  Students are responsible for monitoring the class website for any new material as they are posted.

Homework: Homework are comprised of after-chapter questions and mini-projects.  Data analysis are inherently time consuming, so make sure you budget enough time for course assignment.

Course Projects: Each student will work on a term project to be presented at the last class meeting.  
1.	A midterm proposal, as the midterm examination, is due on July 17.
2.	A draft of the term proposal is due on July 22.
3.	The last class on August 12 is reserved for presentation.  Each student has 25 minutes, with 20 minutes to present and 5 minutes for Q&A.
4.	The term paper is due by 23:59 on Friday August 15.  The paper should be eight to twelve pages double column, following IEEE/Computer Society transaction format, in both PDF format and its original editable format (LaTex, Word, Writer, etc.)
5.	A poster file is due by 23:59 on Friday August 15.   It should be around 32 by 40 inches in size, and in both PDF format and its original editable format (Beamer, PowerPoint, Keynote, etc.).  You do not need to print this poster.
6.	A 45 seconds video is due by 23:59 on Friday August 15, in both a video file and a Youtube item, in which you describe your project in 'plain English'.  It should target a general audience with no technical background.
7.	All source code, input dataset, output, and documentation in a public github account (when applicable)
8.	CS students are expected to write own code for data processing; IT students are expected to employ data processing tools for this project.

Grading Formula: Homework (30%) + Midterm Proposal (20%) + Term Project (40%) + Attendance (10%)
Guaranteed Grade: A (90%), B(80%), C(70%), F(<70%)

Rules:
Attendance: it's understandable if you must miss one lecture because of work conflicts or unforeseeable reasons.  However, you must notify the instructor before the class starts (by email or voice message).  Missing two class meetings without strong reasons may result in grade penalty.

Late Work: Homework assignments, by default, are due in class at the next class meeting.  Late work will be accepted within one week past original deadline, with 50% grade penalty.

Academic Conduct: All homeworks, labs and exams must represent your own individual effort.  Mutual discussion of course assignments is allowed, as long as the results themselves are worked out individually.  Copying another student's work or allowing another student to copy your work is cheating and grounds for disciplinary actions.  Refer to the College Catalog for complete policy regarding academic conducts.
